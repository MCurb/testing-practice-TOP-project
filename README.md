# 🧪 Testing Practice — JavaScript TDD
Part of the **JavaScript Testing** module from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice). <br>
This mini-project focuses entirely on **practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with Jest.

## 🚀 What I Learned
This project helped me deepen my understanding of:
- **Using TDD to guide my code**, instead of relying on endless `console.log()` checks like a caveman.
- **Creating a new branch for every feature**, instead of committing everything to `main`.
- **Writing Conventional Commits** to keep my history clean and readable.
- **Refactoring without fear**, because tests, branches and commits give you confidence that you’re not breaking everything.

## ⚙️ Project Summary

### ✔️ `capitalize(string)`

- Tested capitalizing a single word
- Tested capitalizing full sentences

### ✔️ `reverseString(string)`

- Tested reversing a word
- Tested reversing long strings

### ✔️ `calculator` object

- Tested each operation (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`)
- Used dynamic inputs to check multiple cases

### ✔️ `analyzeArray(array)`

- Practiced testing object equality with `toEqual()`
- Verified average, min, max, and length

### ✔️ `caesarCipher(string, shift)`

- Tested basic shifting
- Tested large shifts
- Tested negative shifts
- Tested wrapping around alphabet boundaries (`xyz → abc`)
- Ensured case preservation
- Ensured punctuation stays the same

## 📚 Concepts Reinforced
- Test-Driven Development
- Jest Matchers
- Clean commit history
- Practical branching workflow
